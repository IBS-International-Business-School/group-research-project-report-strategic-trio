📝 Executive Summary
Business Problem
Modern digital products must satisfy a diverse user base, and a key design decision is whether to adopt a Light-first, Dark-first, or dual-mode approach from the start. While Light Mode has been the default, many users now prefer Dark Mode for reasons like reduced eye strain and better low-light readability. Following the traditional Light-first approach often results in inconsistent visual design, duplicated effort, increased development time, and added testing when Dark Mode is added later. This has led to growing interest in a dual-mode or Dark-first approach starting at the beginning of the design cycle.




Research Objectives
This study explores user preferences to determine if applications should be designed with only Dark Mode or with both Dark and Light modes from the start, rather than using the traditional Light-first method.

To identify user preferences and usage patterns for Dark Mode and Light Mode across devices and contexts using simple questionnaires.

To recommend the optimal design strategy (Light-first, Dark-first, or both) based on user preferences captured through a survey.

💡 Introduction to Definition and Objective
Introduction
User Interface (UI) personalization, particularly the option to switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode, is a key factor in delivering an effective user experience. Dark Mode has gained popularity due to perceived benefits, including reduced eye strain, improved readability in low-light, and modern aesthetics.


Research Subject
To design applications that truly meet user needs, it's essential to understand how often each mode is used, which mode users prefer for everyday use, and the reasons for these preferences.

Objective of this Survey
The primary objective is to determine whether people prefer Dark Mode or Light Mode in digital applications and to understand the factors influencing their choice. The findings will help guide design decisions on whether to prioritize one mode or offer both from the start.


📊 Data and the Results
Methodology

Research: A comprehensive, focused, and non-repetitive set of questions was developed, with input from team members and AI tools.



Design: The questionnaire was kept concise with only nine questions to encourage higher completion rates and avoid respondent fatigue.


Sampling: A random convenience sampling approach was used, sharing the survey with friends and family members. The sample size was appropriate for the project's scope, aiming to understand the survey process and analyze responses.



Data Collection: Data was collected using Google Forms over two weeks, with all questions offering predefined answer options to ensure consistency. Around 200 samples were collected.



Results
The results suggest that users generally prefer Dark Mode over Light Mode, but the preference is not significant enough to justify only building applications in Dark Mode. Overall, about 60% of users prefer Dark Mode but don't use it 100% of the time.


Use of Dark Mode:

37% of users access the feature frequently.

32% use the feature sometimes.

18% use the feature always.

13% never use the feature.

The gap between those who "always" use it (18%) and those who "never" use it (13%) indicates a balanced preference, making it difficult to choose only one mode as a universal default.


Preferred Mode: Dark Mode is the clear leader with over 60% of users leaning towards it. However, since Light Mode is preferred by nearly 40% of users, this number is too considerable to ignore.



Eye Strain Difference: Nearly 50% of users stated that Dark Mode helps with eye strain compared to Light Mode, making Dark Mode a clear leader for this factor.


Visually Attractive: 55% of users prefer Dark Mode for visual appeal. The 55% vs. 45% difference is not significant enough to stick to one mode, emphasizing the importance of building both with the same focus.



Readability of Dark vs Light: 30% of the largest user group reported no difference in readability between Dark or Light Mode. However, users who express a preference generally prefer the darker screen.



Comfort Scale on the Preferred Mode: Approximately 60% of users are on a comfort scale of 7 to 10, proving that users stick to their preferred mode for a longer duration.

🔬 Other Studies
The report reviewed several other studies that explored the effects of display polarity (dark text on light background, or positive polarity, vs. light text on dark background, or negative polarity) on reading and vision:


Reading and Myopia: Reading dark text on a bright background (Light Mode) reduces choroidal thickness in one hour, while reading bright text on a dark background (Dark Mode) increases it. These changes are precursors for future eye growth changes and potential myopia development.


Legibility: The "positive polarity advantage" (Dark text on light background) is more apparent under conditions of dark ambient illumination. Legibility thresholds are generally reduced under bright ambient illumination.


Visually-Impaired: Studies on low vision and visually-impaired individuals highlight the importance of effective colour contrast and legible text for optimal reading performance.



Age and Polarity: An advantage of positive polarity (Dark text on light background) was expected and observed for both younger and older adults.

✅ Recommendations
While the survey indicates a general preference toward Dark Mode, the difference is relatively small, and users often switch modes based on context.

Based on these insights, the recommendation for device and application developers is to adopt a dual-mode design approach, supporting both Dark and Light Modes from the outset.


Dark Mode should no longer be treated as an add-on; it must be incorporated as a core element of the initial design strategy.

The strategy should show a slight preference toward Dark Mode given its overall popularity.

A single-mode priority (either Dark or Light) may be justified for certain applications based on the app’s purpose, target users, and usage environment, to enhance clarity and usability.

♻️ Reflection
Team Process (Agile Principles)
The team successfully applied Agile principles throughout the project:


Daily Stand-ups (15-minute): Used to share updates, identify challenges, and move tasks.


Weekly Sprint Planning: Used to define goals and allocate responsibilities.


Retrospectives: Held at the end of each sprint to reflect on improvements needed.


Planning Board: An Excel sheet was used to maintain a transparent workflow, with tasks regularly updated.
