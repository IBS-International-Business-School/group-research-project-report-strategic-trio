# Executive Summary

**Business Problem:** Modern digital products must meet the expectations of a wide and diverse user base. One of the key decisions made during application development is whether to design the interface in Light Mode first, Dark Mode first, or to build both modes simultaneously. Although Light Mode has traditionally been the default, user behavior has changed significantly in recent years, with many users preferring Dark Mode for reasons such as reduced eye strain, better readability in low-light environments, and modern visual appeal.

When teams follow the conventional Light-first approach and add Dark Mode support later, they often face challenges. These include inconsistent visual design, duplicated effort, increased development time, and the need for additional testing to ensure both modes function correctly. As a result, there is growing interest in understanding whether a dual-mode or Dark-first approach should be considered from the beginning of the design cycle. Making the right decision early can lead to a smoother development process and a better overall user experience.

**Research Objectives:** This study explores user preferences to determine whether digital applications should be designed with only Dark Mode or with both Dark and Light modes from the start, rather than adopting the traditional Light-first method. The research aims to capture how users interact with these modes and what they expect from modern interfaces.

**Objectives:**

- To identify user preferences and usage patterns for Dark Mode and Light Mode across devices and contexts using simple questionnaires.
- To recommend an optimal strategy that fits if we must select; Light-first, Dark-first, or both from the start-based on what people prefer to use, as captured through a survey conducted using online forms.

# Introduction to definition and objective

**Introduction:** As digital applications continue to evolve, user interface (UI) personalization has become a key factor in delivering an effective and comfortable user experience. One of the most widely adopted UI customization features is the option to switch between Dark Mode and Light Mode. While Light Mode has traditionally been the default design for most applications, Dark Mode has gained significant popularity in recent years due to perceived benefits such as reduced eye strain, better readability in low-light environments, and modern aesthetics.

**Research subject:** To design applications that meet real user needs, it is essential to understand how people actually use these modes, what they prefer, and why. This research aims to investigate user preferences for Dark Mode versus Light Mode, including how often each mode is used, which mode users prefer for everyday use, and the reasons behind those preferences.

**Objective of this survey:**

- To determine whether people prefer Dark Mode or Light Mode in digital applications, and to understand the factors influencing their choice.
- By gathering insights from users, this study will help guide design decisions such as whether applications should prioritize one mode, offer both modes from the start, or adopt a mode-first development approach. The findings will support creating more user-centric and accessible digital experiences.

**Research:** We began the study by preparing a comprehensive set of questions related to Dark Mode and Light Mode usage. Each team member contributed their own ideas, and additional questions were generated with the help of AI tools. Once we had a substantial list, we reviewed all the questions together, grouped related items, and removed duplicates. This process ensured that the final set of survey questions was focused, relevant, and non-repetitive.

**Design:** During our discussions, we initially considered conducting a large and detailed survey. However, we recognized that longer surveys often lead to respondent fatigue and incomplete submissions. To encourage higher completion rates, we decided to keep the questionnaire concise with a total of nine questions. These questions were to understand whether people prefer Dark Mode or Light Mode, without collecting any personal or identifiable details. Our goal was to maintain participant comfort while still gathering meaningful data.

**Sampling:** We followed a random convenience sampling approach. Instead of using a research agency or collecting responses from a large and diverse population, we shared the survey with friends and family members. While the sample size may not be enough for publishing a professional research paper, it was appropriate for this project's scope. The main objective was to understand the survey process, analyze the responses collected, and link our observations with existing studies, including those related to age-based preferences.

**Data Collection:** Data was collected using Google Forms, where we uploaded our final set of questions. All questions included predefined answer options so that respondents could simply select from the available choices without typing. This ensured consistency in data and made the process simpler for participants. The survey link was then circulated digitally among our selected sample group, allowing them to complete it at their convenience.

# Data and the Results

**Data Collection:** We have collected around 200 samples as a group from our friends and family over a period of two weeks.

**Results:** The results suggest that the users prefer dark mode over light mode but are not significant enough to stop building applications on the light mode. On an overall 60% users prefer dark mode but again not sticking 100% on dark mode all the time.

**1: Use of dark Mode:** The data shows that 37% of users access the feature frequently, making it the largest group. The next highest is 32%, who say they use the feature sometimes, followed by 18% who report using it always.
When we compare the extremes with the 18% who always use the feature and the 13% who never use it, the gap of just over 10% on each side indicates that user preferences are balanced. This makes it difficult to justify choosing only one mode as the universal default.
However, since 18% (always) is still higher than 13% (never), and 37% (frequently) is higher than 32% (sometimes), the overall trend leans slightly toward higher usage. Therefore, our recommendation is to support both Dark Mode and Light Mode, while giving priority to Dark Mode based on its relatively stronger usage patterns.

**2: Preferred Mode:** This gives us dark mode as the clear leader with over 60% leaning towards the dark approach. We can conclude that we should have dark mode first but have light mode close to 40%, which is a considerable number of decisions making.

**3: Eye strain difference:** In this Dark is a clear leader with nearly 50% stating this helps with eye strain compared to the lighter alternative.

**4: Visually Attractive:** Our survey says 55% of users prefer dark mode over the visual appeal 55 vs 45 is not a significant difference to stick to one more when you build the application. This note makes it equally important to build both modes with the same focus.

**5: Readability of Dark vs Light:** 30% of the users in that largest group say there is no difference in dark or light. On the questions on better or worse with dark screens users prefer the darker screen.

**6: Comfort scale on the preferred mode:** This survey shows that users stick to the preferred mode for longer duration. Around 60% of users are between 7 and 10 which proves this point.

# Other studies

**1: Reading and Myopia: Contrast Polarity Matters.** _"We found that reading dark text on a bright background reduces choroidal thickness in one hour, while reading bright text on dark background increases the thickness of the choroid. Since choroidal thickness changes are precursors for future changes in eye growth, we expect that there will be selective effects on subsequent myopia development. However, there remain a few key questions"_

**2: Effects of ambient illumination, contrast polarity, and letter size on text legibility under glance-like reading, Applied Ergonomics.** _"This study demonstrates that the "positive polarity advantage" is readily apparent under conditions of dark ambient illumination but is only nominally in evidence under bright ambient illumination. Legibility thresholds, as measured via a lexical decision task, are globally reduced under bright ambient illumination, and elevate under dark illumination only for negative polarity text configurations. This would suggest that the "positive polarity advantage" is perhaps better termed "negative"_

**3: Psychophysics of Reading - ii. Low Vision.** "Contrast polarity (white-on-black vs black-on-white text), and character spacing. Despite diverse pathologies and degrees of vision loss in the sample, several major generalizations emerged. There was a wide variation in peak reading rates among Ss, but 64% of the variance could be accounted for by 2 major distinctions: intact central fields vs central-field loss and cloudy vs clear ocular media. Low-vision reading was similar to normal reading in several respects. Results provide estimates of the best reading performance to be expected from low-vision observers with characteristic forms of vision loss and the stimulus parameters necessary for optimal performance."

**4: Accessibility Assistance for Visually-Impaired People in Digital Texts.** "This article describes the effective colour contrast and legible text required by visually-impaired students and presents a new tool, not intended merely to provide another form of computer access for the partially sighted, but to offer a means of education in the regular classroom."

**5: Positive display polarity is advantageous for both younger and older adults.** "An advantage of positive polarity (dark characters on light background) over negative polarity (light characters on dark background) was expected for younger adults, but the effects on older adults were ambiguous. Light scatter due to residues in the senescent lens and vitreous humour could reverse the typical advantage of positive polarity. However, age-related changes lead to a decline in retinal illuminance."

# Recommendations

Our survey indicates that users generally prefer Dark Mode over Light Mode, though the difference between the two is relatively small. Importantly, users often switch modes depending on context - those who prefer Dark Mode still use Light Mode in certain situations, and vice versa. Additional studies we reviewed also highlight valid reasons for choosing either mode based on specific circumstances.

Based on these insights, our recommendation is that device and application developers should adopt a dual-mode design approach, supporting both Dark and Light Modes from the outset. Dark Mode can no longer be treated as an add-on feature introduced later in the design cycle; it should be incorporated as a core element of the initial design strategy, with a slight preference toward Dark Mode given its overall popularity.

However, we also recognize that certain applications may justify prioritizing a single mode either Dark or Light depending on the app's purpose, target users, and usage environment. In such cases, choosing one mode can enhance clarity, usability, and user experience.

# Reflection

**Team Process:** Our team applied key Agile principles throughout the project to maintain steady progress and effective collaboration. We held a 15-minute daily stand-up to share updates, identify challenges, and move tasks across our planning board. We also conducted weekly sprint planning sessions to define our goals and allocate responsibilities for the upcoming week. At the end of each sprint, we held retrospectives to reflect on what went well, what needed improvement, and how we could adjust our approach moving forward.

For **project management**, we used excel sheet for our planning board, which helped keep our workflow transparent. Tasks were regularly updated and moved during daily stand-ups, ensuring everyone stay aligned.

**Activity Selection of Subjects:** We spent the first three days discussing multiple topic options before finalizing our subject. Next, we explored different survey approaches and agreed to use Google Forms, sharing the survey with friends and family for quick and accessible responses.

We then focused on gathering and refining survey questions. Although we generated more than 100 questions-including those created with the help of AI-we narrowed the list to essential items that aligned with our research objective: understanding whether people prefer Dark Mode or Light Mode on their devices.

The **survey** ran from 6 Nov to 20 Nov, and all team members submitted their individual data on 22 Nov. We then merged all the data in GitHub and jointly analyzed the results to understand the patterns in user preferences.

**Challenges and Successes:** One of our major challenges was keeping the survey concise without losing important insights. Through team discussions and sprint retrospectives, we resolved this by prioritizing only the most relevant and user-friendly questions.

Another significant challenge was using GitHub and version control, as all of us were new to these tools. Setting it up, understanding branching, and merging files initially caused delays and confusion. However, with patience, internal guidance, and continuous experimentation, we gradually became more comfortable with the tool. Overcoming this learning curve was a key success in our collaboration.

Despite these challenges, our team worked cohesively. Agile practices-especially daily stand-ups and clear sprint planning-helped reduce miscommunication and ensured steady progress. The structured workflow, combined with teamwork and adaptability, allowed us to complete the project efficiently and deliver meaningful findings.
